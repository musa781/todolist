I'll explain the key technologies used in building this TODO list application:

Frontend:

React with TypeScript - For building the user interface with type safety
TanStack Query (React Query) - For efficient server state management and API calls
Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui - For styling and pre-built components
Wouter - For lightweight client-side routing
React Hook Form - For form handling and validation
Canvas Confetti - For celebration animations
Lucide React - For modern icons
Backend:

Node.js with Express - For the server implementation
In-memory Storage - For data persistence (using MemStorage class)
Zod - For runtime type validation and schema definition
Drizzle ORM - For database schema definition (though currently using in-memory storage)
Development Tools:

Vite - For fast development and optimized production builds
TypeScript - For type safety across the entire application
ESBuild - For efficient JavaScript/TypeScript bundling
The application follows modern practices like:

Component-based architecture
Custom hooks for reusable logic
Real-time state updates
Responsive design
Dark mode support
Type-safe development
